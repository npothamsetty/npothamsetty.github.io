					<p> I often find myself thinking about happy memories. I think gratitude as a practice has made these thoughts <a href="https://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/TwoWolves-Cherokee.html"><u>more common</u></a>. Forcing yourself to think about certain things means that our neurological activities feed on these thoughts and precipitate more thoughts that stem from these <a href="https://twitter.com/krispybacon/status/1294507612378140672?s=20"><u>inputs</u></a>. We spend a lot of our time inputting things into our brains, whether that be TV, Wikipedia rabbit holes, or TIkTok binges. There are less times when we focus on outputs in our everyday lives. This is why we often experience a sense of clarity or novel thoughts when we do something where we are not on our phones, such as showering or right as we are about to fall asleep. The key is to feed your brain with thoughts that are going to precipitate the thoughts that you want. If you want to have deeper thoughts about <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/kids/explore/who-is/who-yayoi-kusama"><u>Yayoi Kusama</u></a>, for example, look at her art, read her biography, watch her interviews, and make everything you consume related to her and her work. Youâ€™ll soon find connections to that in the everyday world. </p><br>
