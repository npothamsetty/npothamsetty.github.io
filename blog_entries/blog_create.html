					<p> <a href="../blog_entries/blog_20210819.html"><u>We can learn a lot from consuming art</u></a>, but I recently discovered that we learn a lot by creating art as well. I am fairly new to the creation business. I have never really considered myself an “artist” of any kind. However, recently I realized the importance of expressing yourself in non-traditional ways. For example, as opposed to speaking, journaling, or doing anything that uses words, there are other media such as painting, music, and even website design that can capture different facets of our emotions that words can’t.</p><br>

					<p> Creating has been really satisfying- it’s nice to spend time alone, work on stuff, and <a href="../blog_entries/blog_20210918.html"><u>unleash my inner child</u></a>. It’s not for anything or anyone beyond my own enjoyment, but it’s cool to connect with others about art you’ve created or the work you do. I get excited when I talk about it- to bring a vision into existence is magical. And when you create something that other people also “get” is such a great feeling. That’s why a chorus of laughs is so empowering. </p><br>
