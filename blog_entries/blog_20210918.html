			<h1>Unleashing the Inner Child</h1>

					<p>In <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2gZUPNdnz5Y45eiGxpHGSc?si=2edb8e0713b3407f"><u>Power,</u></a> Kanye West raps about fighting for the custody of his “inner child.” A reference to the loss of creativity and curiosity many people lose as they grow older, this line had new significance for me as a fairly new graduate. In college, I doggedly pursued my interests through schoolwork, independent projects, and community engagement. Though my job allows me to learn, investigate, and contribute to something that matters, I still view it as leasing my brain out to another entity. I’m not pursuing my own lines of inquiry; my personal projects and interests are no longer my greatest priority. Though fighting for my inner child has been harder after starting my new job, I started to feel the same way as a student research assistant last year. I would often spend more time working on others’ projects than on my own. Two months ago, the steep learning curve of my new job left me mentally exhausted at the end of every workday.</p> <br>

					<p>No matter what stage in your education/career you’re in, I hope you think about what connecting to your “inner child” looks like. There’s a lot of pressure to find our “dream job”, but we can find fulfillment in pursuing other projects that interest us. Projects don’t have to be “intellectual”: starting a business and making music are two examples of following and fostering your passions and, more importantly, retaining and developing a sense of self. </p> <br>

					<p>It will take some work to run with an idea and create something. It’s a lot more difficult to work on this blog than to watch TV or read. However, critical thinking and creating are two of the best ways to grow, learn, and understand. It is also important to talk about and share your ideas and work. In school, we were forced to do so. If you were lucky, you found people you could share your observations and curiosities with. If you’re passionate about what you’re doing, chances are someone would love to hear about it. Especially if that person cares about you—or cares about the topic too.</p> <br>
