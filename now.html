				<p> I recently graduated from UC Berkeley's MPH program in epidemiology and biostatistics. Until I  begin working at Kaiser Permanente 
				in July of 2021, I'll be visiting friends and family in Florida, Hawaii, and Chicago. I'm having a great time training my puppy Appa,
				and I've learned a lot about myself in the process. I've also been writings, and my work is featured on <a href="https://www.planetforward.org/users/navya-pothamsetty"> <u>Planet Forward,</u></a> 
				the <a href="https://pha.berkeley.edu/author/navya-pothamsetty/"> <u>Public Health Advocate,</u></a>
