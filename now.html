				<p> I'm involved in a few health education organizations on campus including Peer Health Exchange 
				and the Health Service Internship. I love to teach because effective education is communication in its purest form,
				and I'm constantly trying to figure out how to package information in ways different individuals can understand, process,
				and apply it. I love to write for similar reasons, and my work is featured on <a href="https://www.planetforward.org/users/navya-pothamsetty"> <u>Planet Forward</u> </a>, the <a href="https://pha.berkeley.edu/author/navya-pothamsetty/"> <u>Public Health Advocate</u> </a>,
				and the Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces blog.</p>

				<p> Academically, I'm interested in safety net hospital administration and integration of community resources and government
				benefits into primary care visits. I'm hoping to pursue a Master's in epidemiology and biostatistics after I graduate in 2020. </p>

				<p> My personal goal for the summer is to run a sub-two hour half-marathon. After an acute overtraining
					injury resulting from a marathon I ran this past March, I'm focusing on holistic form and technique rather than 
					running a certain distance. I love to run for its mental and physical benefits: <a href="http://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir"> <u>Haruki Murakami</u> </a> 
					can put into words better than I can how this is true.</p>

				<p>I'm reading <i>Atomic Habits</i> by James Clear to learn how to use small behavioral changes to become a better person, physically,
					mentally, and emotionally. I'm listening to Dissect, a podcast deconstructing some of this generation's greatest albums. I'm still on the first season discussing Kendrick Lamar's <i> To Pimp A Butterfly</i>. </p>
